# Visual-Programming-with-Java
This code is for understand visual programing logic in java.
If the user wants to enter name by her/himself the user uses the text field but if the user wants to see random names which is in txt file then the program does it.
after all if the text area not empty-the user can fill the text area with 'before save file' button- the informations are saved in another file.
Actually i could have done this with database but for now i did this processwith file. Because i wanted to show file handling in java. 
Also the user can change the texts colour with color chooser.
